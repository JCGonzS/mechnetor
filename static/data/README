DATA FILES FOR INT2MECH & PIV


Two scripts:
->  "prepare_data... .py"

->  "make_protein_data_json.py"



The following are the required data files, where they come from and how they were reduced
to speed up their reading.


  3did - Database of three-dimensional interacting domains
  https://3did.irbbarcelona.org/

  	Source file: "3did_flat_July2018.gz"
  	Data file:   "3did_flat_July2018_edited.txt.gz"
	
	Description: considerably reduced number of lines. Only those required by int2mech
	remain.



"elm_classes.tsv"
	Source: elm.eu.org
	Contains all the classes of LM in the database with their regular expressions (RE) 
	and probabilities.
	
	This file is used by "find_all_elms.py", which uses the REs to find all ELMs
	present in a provided fasta file. The results is the file "elm_hits.tsv", which
	is required by int2mech.py
